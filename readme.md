# Node.js GraphQL API Template with Apollo Server

This is a simple Node.js template for building a GraphQL API using Apollo Server.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd node-graphql-api-template
```

2. Install the required modules using npm:

```bash
npm install apollo-server graphql
```

## Usage

1. Start the server:

```bash
node app.js
```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4000` to access the Apollo Server Playground.

3. Use the Playground to test your GraphQL API by running queries. For example:

```graphql
query {
  books {
    id
    title
    author
  }
}
```

4. You can also use the 'book' query to get a specific book by ID:

```graphql
query {
  book(id: "1") {
    id
    title
    author
  }
}
```

## Customization

You can customize this template to add more types, mutations, or data sources as needed for your GraphQL API.
